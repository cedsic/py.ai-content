overview: |
  **ROS Python interfaces** provide a powerful and user-friendly bridge between the versatile Python programming language and the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. By enabling seamless interaction with ROS components such as topics, services, and actions, these interfaces empower developers, researchers, and engineers to build sophisticated robotic applications without delving into low-level hardware complexities.
  <br>
  With Python’s simplicity and ROS’s modular architecture, ROS Python interfaces unlock rapid prototyping, testing, and deployment of robotic behaviors — from sensor data processing to autonomous navigation.

  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  ROS Python interfaces are primarily provided via the `rospy` client library (ROS1) and `rclpy` (ROS2). These libraries expose ROS communication primitives:

  - 📢 **Publishers/Subscribers:** Publish or subscribe to topics for asynchronous data exchange.
  - 🔄 **Services:** Synchronous request/response communication.
  - 🎯 **Actions:** Preemptible long-running tasks with feedback and result reporting.

  They handle serialization/deserialization of ROS messages and manage node lifecycle, enabling Python scripts to act as fully-fledged ROS nodes.

  ## 🐍 Example: Basic ROS Python Publisher

  ```python
  import rclpy
  from rclpy.node import Node
  from std_msgs.msg import String

  class MinimalPublisher(Node):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
          self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
          timer_period = 1  # seconds
          self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
          self.i = 0

      def timer_callback(self):
          msg = String()
          msg.data = f'Hello ROS {self.i}'
          self.publisher_.publish(msg)
          self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
          self.i += 1

  def main(args=None):
      rclpy.init(args=args)
      minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
      rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
      minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
      rclpy.shutdown()

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
  ```
