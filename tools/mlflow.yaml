  ## 🛠️ Technical Overview

  MLflow is composed of four main components:

  1. **📊 MLflow Tracking:**  
    A REST API and UI to log and query experiments, parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

  2. **📦 MLflow Projects:**  
    Define reusable and reproducible projects using a standardized `MLproject` file.

  3. **🤖 MLflow Models:**  
    Standardized format to package models for deployment across diverse platforms.

  4. **📚 MLflow Model Registry:**   
    Collaborative hub to register, annotate, and manage model lifecycle stages.

  ## 🐍 Example: Tracking Experiments with MLflow in Python

  ```python
  import mlflow
  import mlflow.sklearn
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load data
  iris = load_iris()
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
      iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
  )

  # Start MLflow experiment
  with mlflow.start_run():
      # Train model
      clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3)
      clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

      # Predict and evaluate
      preds = clf.predict(X_test)
      acc = accuracy_score(y_test, preds)

      # Log parameters and metrics
      mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
      mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 3)
      mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)

      # Log model
      mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, "random_forest_model")

      print(f"Logged model with accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet demonstrates how easily MLflow can track a simple model training experiment, capturing parameters, metrics, and the model artifact automatically.
