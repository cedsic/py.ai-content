  ## 🐍 Polars in Action: Python Example

  ```python
  import polars as pl

  # Load a large CSV file
  df = pl.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

  # Aggregate total sales by region and product category
  result = (
      df.groupby(["region", "category"])
        .agg([
            pl.col("sales").sum().alias("total_sales"),
            pl.col("quantity").mean().alias("avg_quantity")
        ])
        .sort("total_sales", reverse=True)
  )

  print(result)
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet demonstrates how Polars can quickly load data, perform group-by aggregations, and sort results—all with concise, readable syntax.
