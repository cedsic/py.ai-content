overview: |
  Seaborn is a powerful Python visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed to make statistical graphics **more attractive, informative, and easier to create**. It abstracts away much of the complexity involved in plotting complex statistical relationships, allowing users to focus on data insight rather than intricate plotting details. By leveraging Pandas DataFrames and integrating seamlessly with the broader Python data stack, Seaborn has become a go-to tool for data scientists, analysts, and researchers.

  ## 🐍 Example: Visualizing Tips Dataset

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Load example dataset
  tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

  # Create a violin plot to visualize total bill distribution by day and sex
  plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
  sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="sex", data=tips, split=True, palette="muted")
  plt.title("Total Bill Distribution by Day and Gender")
  plt.show()
  ```
  <br>
  This code snippet demonstrates how easily Seaborn creates a **split violin plot** that compares distributions across categories with minimal code.
