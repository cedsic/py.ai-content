  ## 🐍 Python Example: Getting Started with H2O AutoML

  ```python
  import h2o
  from h2o.automl import H2OAutoML

  # Initialize H2O cluster
  h2o.init()

  # Load dataset
  data = h2o.import_file("https://h2o-public-test-data.s3.amazonaws.com/smalldata/iris/iris_wheader.csv")

  # Specify features and target
  x = data.columns[:-1]
  y = "class"

  # Convert target to factor for classification
  data[y] = data[y].asfactor()

  # Split data into train and test
  train, test = data.split_frame(ratios=[.8], seed=1234)

  # Run AutoML for 20 base models
  aml = H2OAutoML(max_models=20, seed=1)
  aml.train(x=x, y=y, training_frame=train)

  # View leaderboard
  lb = aml.leaderboard
