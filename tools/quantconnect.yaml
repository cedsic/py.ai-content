  ### Example: Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy in Python

  ```python
  from AlgorithmImports import *

  class SMACrossoverAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):

      def Initialize(self):
          self.SetStartDate(2022, 1, 1)
          self.SetEndDate(2023, 1, 1)
          self.SetCash(100000)
          
          self.symbol = self.AddEquity("AAPL", Resolution.Daily).Symbol
          
          self.fast_sma = self.SMA(self.symbol, 50, Resolution.Daily)
          self.slow_sma = self.SMA(self.symbol, 200, Resolution.Daily)
          
          self.previous = None
          
      def OnData(self, data):
          if not self.fast_sma.IsReady or not self.slow_sma.IsReady:
              return
          
          if self.previous is None:
              self.previous = self.fast_sma.Current.Value > self.slow_sma.Current.Value
              return
          
          current = self.fast_sma.Current.Value > self.slow_sma.Current.Value
          
          # Golden cross - buy signal
