  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspect

  At its core, FLAML employs **adaptive, cost-aware search algorithms** that intelligently balance exploration and exploitation of the hyperparameter space. Unlike brute-force or Bayesian optimization methods that can be computationally expensive, FLAML:

  - Uses **low-cost surrogate models** to estimate performance.
  - Prioritizes **fast evaluation** of promising configurations.
  - Continuously adapts search strategies based on intermediate results.

  This approach results in **significantly reduced training times** and **lower resource consumption** without sacrificing model quality.

  ## 🐍 FLAML in Action: Python Example

  ```python
  from flaml import AutoML
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Load dataset
  X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

  # Initialize AutoML
  automl = AutoML()

  # Specify task and time budget
  automl_settings = {
      "time_budget": 30,  # seconds
      "metric": 'accuracy',
      "task": 'classification',
      "log_file_name": "flaml_iris.log",
  }

  # Train with FLAML
  automl.fit(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train, **automl_settings)

  # Predict and evaluate
  y_pred = automl.predict(X_test)
  print(f"Best ML learner: {automl.best_estimator}")
  print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.4f}")
  ```
