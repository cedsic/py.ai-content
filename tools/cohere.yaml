  ## 🐍 Python Example: Generate Text & Embeddings  💻📚

  ```python
  import cohere

  # Initialize client with your API key
  co = cohere.Client('YOUR_API_KEY')

  # Generate text
  response = co.generate(
      model='xlarge',
      prompt='Write a short summary about the benefits of NLP in healthcare.',
      max_tokens=60,
      temperature=0.7
  )
  print("Generated Text:\n", response.generations[0].text)

  # Get embeddings
  texts = ["Natural Language Processing is transforming industries.", "Healthcare benefits from AI."]
  embeddings_response = co.embed(texts=texts)
  print("Embeddings shape:", len(embeddings_response.embeddings), "x", len(embeddings_response.embeddings[0]))
  ```
  <br>
  This example demonstrates how to use the Cohere API in Python to both generate human-like text and create numerical embeddings for semantic understanding tasks.
