  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects

  At its core, the Python extension for VS Code leverages the **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** to provide language intelligence features. The default language server, **Pylance**, is built on Microsoft’s Pyright static type checker, offering lightning-fast type checking and autocomplete.

  The debugger is based on the **Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)**, enabling rich debugging experiences including remote debugging and multi-threaded applications.

  VS Code Python tools detect Python interpreters by scanning your system and virtual environments, letting you switch interpreters with a simple command palette action.

  ## 🐍 Example: Writing and Debugging Python Code in VS Code

  ```python
  def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
      """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
      sequence = [0, 1]
      for _ in range(2, n):
          next_value = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
          sequence.append(next_value)
      return sequence

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      terms = 10
      print(f"First {terms} Fibonacci numbers: {fibonacci(terms)}")
  ```
  <br>
  **How VS Code helps:**  

    - ✨ Autocompletion suggests `append()` and variable names.  <br>  
    - 🚨 Inline linting warns if types don’t match.  <br>  
    - 🐞 Debugger lets you step through the loop, inspect `sequence` at each iteration.  <br>  
    - 📓 You can run tests or Jupyter notebooks side-by-side.
