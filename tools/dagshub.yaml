  ### Example: Tracking an Experiment with Dagshub Python SDK

  ```python
  from dagshub import DAGsHub

  # Initialize Dagshub client (replace with your repo URL)
  client = DAGsHub(repo_url="https://dagshub.com/username/project")

  # Log hyperparameters
  client.log_params({
      "learning_rate": 0.01,
      "batch_size": 32,
      "epochs": 10
  })

  # Log metrics after training
  client.log_metrics({
      "accuracy": 0.92,
      "loss": 0.15
  })

  # Push changes to Dagshub
  client.push()
  ```
