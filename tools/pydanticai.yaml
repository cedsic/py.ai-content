overview: |
  In the rapidly evolving world of AI, **language models (LLMs)** generate vast amounts of data—but often in inconsistent or unpredictable formats. Enter **PydanticAI**, a powerful tool that **combines Pydantic’s robust data validation with AI systems**, ensuring that AI-generated outputs are **structured, reliable, and ready for production**.
  <br>
  By enforcing schemas on LLM responses, PydanticAI transforms raw, free-form text into **well-defined Python objects**, eliminating guesswork and reducing errors downstream.

  ## 🔗 Integration with Other Tools 🔗

  PydanticAI fits naturally into the **Python AI ecosystem** and can be combined with:

  - **LangChain, LlamaIndex, or other LLM orchestration frameworks** — to validate outputs in multi-step pipelines.
  - **FastAPI & Web frameworks** — to validate AI-generated JSON responses before sending to clients.
  - **Data processing libraries (Pandas, Dask)** — to ensure AI outputs are clean before analysis.
  - **Cloud AI services (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face)** — to wrap responses with validation layers.

  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview ⚙️

  At its core, PydanticAI extends Pydantic’s `BaseModel` to validate **language model responses** against strict schemas. It can parse raw text or JSON-like outputs and:

  - 🛑 Enforce required fields
  - 📚 Validate nested objects and lists
  - 🐞 Provide detailed error messages for debugging
  - 🧙‍♂️ Support custom validators to handle AI-specific quirks

  ## 🧪 Example: Validating AI Survey Responses with PydanticAI

  ```python
  from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError
  from pydantic_ai import validate_ai_response  # hypothetical import

  class SurveyResponse(BaseModel):
      user_id: int
      satisfaction: int  # 1 to 5
      feedback: str

  # Simulated AI output (could be raw JSON string from LLM)
  ai_output = '''
  {
      "user_id": 123,
      "satisfaction": 4,
      "feedback": "Great service, very helpful!"
  }
  '''

  try:
      # Validate and parse the LLM response
      response = validate_ai_response(SurveyResponse, ai_output)
      print("Validated response:", response)
  except ValidationError as e:
      print("Validation failed:", e)
  ```
  <br>
  This simple pattern ensures your AI-generated data is **always clean, typed, and ready** for database insertion or further processing.
