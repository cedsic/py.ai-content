overview: |
  Altair is a **declarative statistical visualization library** for Python that empowers data scientists, analysts, and researchers to create clear, concise, and insightful graphics with minimal code. Unlike traditional plotting tools that require step-by-step instructions on how to render charts, Altair lets you specify *what* you want to visualize. It then automatically handles the *how*, producing beautiful, interactive, and reproducible visualizations.
  <br>
  Built on top of the powerful <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vega-Lite</a> visualization grammar, Altair bridges the gap between simplicity and expressiveness, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis and presentation alike.

  ## 🐍 Altair in Action — Python Example

  ```python
  import altair as alt
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np

  # Create sample data
  np.random.seed(42)
  data = pd.DataFrame({
      'Category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], 200),
      'Value1': np.random.randn(200),
      'Value2': np.random.randn(200) * 50 + 20
  })

  # Scatter plot with color encoding and interactive selection
  selection = alt.selection_multi(fields=['Category'], bind='legend')

  chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
      x='Value1',
      y='Value2',
      color=alt.condition(selection, 'Category', alt.value('lightgray')),
      tooltip=['Category', 'Value1', 'Value2']
  ).add_selection(
      selection
  ).properties(
      title='Interactive Scatter Plot by Category'
  )

  chart.show()
  ```
  <br>
  This example demonstrates how Altair enables **interactive, multi-category scatter plots** with just a few lines of code.
