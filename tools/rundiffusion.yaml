  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  RunDiffusion hosts **diffusion models**—a class of generative models that iteratively refine noise into coherent images guided by textual descriptions.

  - **Model Types:** Supports popular architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and custom fine-tuned variants.
  - **Backend:** Runs on scalable GPU clusters managed via Kubernetes and optimized for low-latency inference.
  - **API:** RESTful endpoints accepting prompt text, generation parameters (e.g., steps, guidance scale), and returning URLs or binary image data.
  - **Security:** Encrypted data channels (HTTPS), user authentication, and usage quotas to ensure privacy and fair use.

  def generate_image(prompt: str, steps: int = 50, width: int = 512, height: int = 512):
      headers = {
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
      payload = {
          "prompt": prompt,
          "steps": steps,
          "width": width,
          "height": height,
          "num_images": 1
      }
      response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers)
      response.raise_for_status()
      image_url = response.json()['images'][0]
      return image_url
