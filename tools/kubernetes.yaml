overview: |
  **Kubernetes** (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is the industry-leading open-source platform designed to **automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications**. Originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes abstracts away the complexity of managing infrastructure, empowering developers and operators to focus on building resilient, scalable applications that run consistently across cloud and on-premises environments.

  ## 🔄 Integration with Other Tools

  Kubernetes is often the **central orchestration hub** in modern cloud-native stacks:

  | Tool/Technology      | Integration Purpose                                      |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Helm**            | Package manager for Kubernetes applications (charts).  |
  | **Kubeflow**        | Machine learning toolkit running on Kubernetes.         |
  | **Istio**           | Service mesh for advanced traffic management & security.|
  | **Prometheus & Grafana** | Monitoring and visualization of cluster metrics.          |
  | **ArgoCD / Jenkins X** | GitOps and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.   |
  | **Docker / container runtimes** | Container building and runtime engines.                  |
  | **Airflow**              | Workflow orchestration and pipeline management on Kubernetes clusters. |
  | **MLflow**               | Experiment tracking and model lifecycle management integrated with Kubernetes deployments. |
  | **Prefect**              | Dataflow automation and orchestration that can run on Kubernetes. |
  | **Comet.ml**             | Monitoring and visualization of ML experiments running in Kubernetes pods. |

  ## ⚙️ Technical Architecture Overview

  Kubernetes architecture consists of two main components:

  | Component      | Role                                                                                   |
  |----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Control Plane (Master)** | Manages cluster state, scheduling, API server, controller manager, and etcd (key-value store). |
  | **Worker Nodes**           | Run the application Pods. Each node has a kubelet agent and container runtime.          |

  ### How it works:

  1. Developers write **declarative YAML manifests** describing desired resources (Pods, Services, Deployments).
  2. The **API server** receives these manifests.
  3. The **scheduler** assigns Pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
  4. The **controller manager** ensures the cluster matches the desired state, handling scaling, updates, and failures.
  5. The **kubelet** on each node manages Pod lifecycle and communicates node status back to the control plane.

  ## 🐍 Kubernetes & Python Ecosystem

  Python developers benefit greatly from Kubernetes, especially in:

  - **ML/AI workflows:** Using Kubeflow, which is Python-friendly for model training and deployment.
  - **Automation & scripting:** The official [Kubernetes Python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) allows programmatic interaction with clusters.

  ### Example: Python script to list all Pods in a namespace

  ```python
  from kubernetes import client, config

  # Load kubeconfig and initialize client
  config.load_kube_config()
  v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

  namespace = 'default'
  pods = v1.list_namespaced_pod(namespace)

  print(f"Pods in namespace '{namespace}':")
  for pod in pods.items:
      print(f" - {pod.metadata.name} (Status: {pod.status.phase})")
  ```

  | **Google GKE**      | Managed Kubernetes on Google Cloud                     | $0.10 per cluster-hour + cloud resource fees  |
  | **Azure AKS**       | Managed Kubernetes on Azure                            | Free control plane, pay for nodes/resources   |
  | **Docker Swarm**    | Simpler container orchestration, less feature-rich    | Free, included with Docker                     |
  | **Nomad (HashiCorp)** | Lightweight scheduler for containers and non-containerized apps | Open-source (free) and enterprise versions    |

  > **Note:** Kubernetes itself is **free and open-source**, but managed services and enterprise distributions typically charge based on usage or subscriptions.
