  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects

  At its core, TensorFlow utilizes **dataflow graphs** to represent computations:

  - **Nodes** represent mathematical operations.
  - **Edges** represent multidimensional data arrays (tensors) flowing between operations.

  This graph-based approach enables:

  - **Parallelism:** Efficient execution on multiple CPUs/GPUs/TPUs.
  - **Portability:** Graphs can be serialized and run independently of the original code.
  - **Optimization:** Graph transformations improve speed and memory usage.

  TensorFlow supports both **eager execution** (imperative programming style) and **graph execution**, balancing ease of debugging with performance.

  ## 🐍 TensorFlow in Python: A Simple Example

  Here’s a quick example demonstrating how to build and train a neural network on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras:

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

  # Load and preprocess data
  mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
  x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

  # Build a simple model
  model = models.Sequential([
      layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
      layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
      layers.Dropout(0.2),
      layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Train the model
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

  # Evaluate the model
  test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
  print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")
  ```
