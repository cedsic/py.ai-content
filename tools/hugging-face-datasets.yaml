  ## 🐍 Example: Loading and Using a Dataset in Python

  ```python
  from datasets import load_dataset

  # Load the IMDb movie reviews dataset
  dataset = load_dataset("imdb")

  # Inspect the first example
  print(dataset['train'][0])

  # Filter positive reviews only
  positive_reviews = dataset['train'].filter(lambda x: x['label'] == 1)

  # Convert to PyTorch DataLoader for training
  from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

  def collate_fn(batch):
      return [item['text'] for item in batch], [item['label'] for item in batch]

  train_loader = DataLoader(positive_reviews, batch_size=16, collate_fn=collate_fn)

  for texts, labels in train_loader:
      print(texts[:2], labels[:2])
      break
  ```
