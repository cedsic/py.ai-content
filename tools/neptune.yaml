  ### Example: Tracking an Experiment with PyTorch and Neptune

  ```python
  import neptune.new as neptune
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  import torch.optim as optim

  # Initialize Neptune run
  run = neptune.init(project='your_workspace/your_project', api_token='YOUR_API_TOKEN')

  # Log hyperparameters
  params = {'lr': 0.001, 'batch_size': 64, 'epochs': 10}
  run['parameters'] = params

  # Dummy training loop
  model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
  optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=params['lr'])
  criterion = nn.MSELoss()

  for epoch in range(params['epochs']):
      # Simulate training loss
      loss = torch.rand(1).item()
      # Log loss metric to Neptune
      run['train/loss'].log(loss)
      print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")

  # Upload model checkpoint
  torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
  run['model/checkpoint'].upload('model.pth')

  # Stop Neptune run
  run.stop()
  ```
