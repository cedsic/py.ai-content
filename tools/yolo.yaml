overview: |
  **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) is a groundbreaking deep learning model designed for **real-time object detection**. Unlike traditional detection methods that rely on multiple stages and complex pipelines, YOLO revolutionizes the approach by framing object detection as a **single regression problem**. This enables it to process images and video streams with remarkable speed while maintaining high accuracy.
  <br>
  YOLO has become a staple in computer vision applications that demand both **speed** and **precision**, from autonomous vehicles to security systems.

  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects 🧮

  YOLO divides an input image into an **S × S grid**. Each grid cell predicts:

  - **Bounding boxes** (with coordinates and confidence scores)  
  - **Class probabilities** for objects within the cell

  The network outputs a tensor encoding all these predictions simultaneously, enabling end-to-end training and inference.

  YOLO uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** with multiple layers of feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities.

  <br>
  ### Example: Running YOLOv5 Inference in Python

  ```python
  import torch
  from PIL import Image

  # Load a pretrained YOLOv5 model from PyTorch Hub
  model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', pretrained=True)

  # Load an image
  img = Image.open('test_image.jpg')

  # Perform inference
  results = model(img)

  # Print detected objects
  print(results.pandas().xyxy[0])  # Bounding boxes with labels and confidence

  # Display results
  results.show()
  ```
