  ## 🐍 Example: Using LLaMA with Hugging Face Transformers in Python

  ```python
  from transformers import LlamaTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM

  # Load tokenizer and model (example: 7B model)
  tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b")
  model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b")

  # Encode input text
  input_text = "Explain the benefits of LLaMA in NLP research."
  inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

  # Generate output
  outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)
  generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

  print(generated_text)
