  Example: Converting a Pillow image to a NumPy array for ML processing

  ```python
  from PIL import Image
  import numpy as np

  img = Image.open('example.jpg')
  img_array = np.array(img)
  print(f"Image shape: {img_array.shape}")
  ```

  ## 🖼️ Example: Creating a Thumbnail with Pillow

  ```python
  from PIL import Image

  def create_thumbnail(input_path, output_path, size=(128, 128)):
      with Image.open(input_path) as img:
          img.thumbnail(size)
          img.save(output_path)
          print(f"Thumbnail saved at {output_path}")

  create_thumbnail('input.jpg', 'thumbnail.jpg')
  ```
