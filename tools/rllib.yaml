  ## 🏗️ Technical Overview

  RLlib’s architecture centers around **policy abstractions** and **distributed rollout workers**:

  - **Rollout Workers** interact with environments to collect experience in parallel.
  - **Policy Evaluators** apply RL algorithms to update agent policies using collected data.
  - **Trainer API** orchestrates the entire training loop, managing resources and scheduling.

  The system supports both **on-policy** and **off-policy** algorithms, multi-agent setups, and custom training loops.

  ## 💡 Example: Training a PPO Agent in RLlib

  ```python
  import ray
  from ray import tune
  from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig

  # Initialize Ray
  ray.init()

  # Configure PPO trainer
  ppo_config = PPOConfig().environment("CartPole-v1").framework("torch").resources(num_gpus=0)

  # Run training with Tune
  tune.run(
      "PPO",
      config=ppo_config.to_dict(),
      stop={"episode_reward_mean": 200},
      verbose=1
  )

  # Shutdown Ray
  ray.shutdown()
  ```

  This example shows how easily you can spin up a distributed RL experiment with RLlib using just a few lines of Python code.
