  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects

  - **🖥️ Runtime Environment**: Each notebook runs on a virtual machine hosted by Google, with a Linux backend. You get access to CPUs, GPUs (NVIDIA Tesla K80, T4, P100, or V100 depending on availability), and TPUs.

  - **⏳ Session Limits**: Sessions can last up to 12 hours (or less for GPUs/TPUs), after which the environment resets. Data should be saved externally to avoid loss.

  - **🐍 Python Version**: Supports Python 3.x (usually the latest stable release).

  - **📦 Package Management**: Pre-installed major libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and more. Install others on-the-fly using `!pip install package_name`.

  ## 🧠 Example: Training a Simple Neural Network on MNIST with TensorFlow

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
  from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

  # Load data
  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

  # Preprocess data
  x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
  y_train_cat = to_categorical(y_train)
  y_test_cat = to_categorical(y_test)

  # Build model
  model = Sequential([
      Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
      Dense(128, activation='relu'),
      Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Train model
  model.fit(x_train, y_train_cat, epochs=5, validation_data=(x_test, y_test_cat))
  ```
