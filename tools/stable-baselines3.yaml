  ## 🐍 Quick Start Example in Python

  ```python
  import gym
  from stable_baselines3 import PPO

  # Create environment
  env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")

  # Initialize model
  model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)

  # Train the agent
  model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

  # Save the trained model
  model.save("ppo_cartpole")

  # Load and evaluate
  model = PPO.load("ppo_cartpole")
  obs = env.reset()
  for _ in range(1000):
      action, _states = model.predict(obs)
      obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action)
      env.render()
      if done:
          obs = env.reset()
