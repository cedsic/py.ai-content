  ```python
  import numpy as np
  from scipy import integrate, optimize

  # Define a function to integrate
  def f(x):
      return np.exp(-x**2)

  # Compute the integral of f from 0 to 1
  integral, error = integrate.quad(f, 0, 1)
  print(f"Integral of exp(-x^2) from 0 to 1: {integral:.5f}")

  # Define a function for root finding
  def g(x):
      return x**3 - 1

  # Find the root near 1
  root = optimize.root_scalar(g, bracket=[0, 2])
  print(f"Root of x^3 - 1 near 1: {root.root:.5f}")
