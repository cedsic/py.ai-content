  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  At its core, Unity ML-Agents operates through a **client-server architecture**:

  1. **Unity Environment (Server)**  
    - Runs the simulation, physics, and rendering.  
    - Defines agent observations (e.g., visual input, vector sensors).  
    - Applies actions received from the Python client.  
    - Computes rewards and manages episode lifecycles.

  2. **Python API (Client)**  
    - Implements RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, etc.) using frameworks like TensorFlow.  
    - Sends actions to Unity and receives state information.  
    - Handles training loops, policy updates, and checkpointing.

  ## 🐍 Sample Python Code: Training an Agent with ML-Agents

  ```python
  from mlagents_envs.environment import UnityEnvironment
  from mlagents_envs.side_channel.engine_configuration_channel import EngineConfigurationChannel

  # Configure Unity environment
  engine_channel = EngineConfigurationChannel()
  env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="YourUnityEnv.exe", side_channels=[engine_channel])
  engine_channel.set_configuration_parameters(time_scale=20.0)  # Speed up simulation

  env.reset()
  behavior_name = list(env.behavior_specs)[0]
  spec = env.behavior_specs[behavior_name]

  for episode in range(10):
      env.reset()
      decision_steps, terminal_steps = env.get_steps(behavior_name)
      done = False

      while not done:
          # Sample random actions for all agents
          action = spec.action_spec.random_action(len(decision_steps))
          env.set_actions(behavior_name, action)
          env.step()

          decision_steps, terminal_steps = env.get_steps(behavior_name)
          done = len(terminal_steps) > 0

  env.close()
