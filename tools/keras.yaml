overview: |
  Keras is a **high-level neural networks API**, written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation and effortless development of deep learning models. Originally developed by François Chollet, Keras has become one of the most popular frameworks in the AI community due to its **user-friendly interface**, **modularity**, and seamless integration with powerful backends like TensorFlow.
  <br>
  Building complex neural networks can often feel daunting, but Keras abstracts away much of the complexity, allowing developers, researchers, and students to focus on innovation rather than boilerplate code.

  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects

  At its core, Keras abstracts the complexity of neural network computation with:

  - **Layer API:** Compose models by stacking layers like `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `LSTM`.
  - **Model API:** Two main styles:
      - **Sequential API:** For simple linear stacks of layers.
      - **Functional API:** For complex architectures with multiple inputs/outputs and shared layers.
  - **Compile Step:** Specify loss functions, optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop), and evaluation metrics.
  - **Fit Method:** Train models with flexible batch sizes, epochs, and callbacks.
  - **Customizability:** Define custom layers, losses, and metrics using Python subclasses.

  ## 🖥️ Example: Simple Image Classifier in Keras

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

  # Define a simple CNN for image classification
  model = models.Sequential([
      layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
      layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
      layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      layers.Flatten(),
      layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  # Compile the model
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Summary of the model
  model.summary()
  ```
