  ### 🐍 Python Example: Generating an Image with the API

  ```python
  import openai

  openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

  response = openai.Image.create(
      prompt="A futuristic city skyline at sunset, digital art",
      n=1,
      size="1024x1024"
  )

  image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
  print(f"Generated Image URL: {image_url}")
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet sends a prompt to the DALL·E API and returns a URL to the generated image.
