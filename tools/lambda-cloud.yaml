overview: |
  Lambda Cloud is designed specifically for **AI research and production training**.  
  Unlike generic cloud providers, it ships **GPU servers pre-loaded with CUDA, cuDNN, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX**, letting ML teams start training immediately.  

  Lambda positions itself between **big cloud vendors (AWS/GCP)** and **bare-metal GPU providers (Vast.ai, RunPod)** by offering **ease of use + predictable performance**.

  ## 🚀 Key Strengths  

  - 🚀 **Pre-configured deep learning stack** – no setup headaches; supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX out-of-the-box.  
  - 💾 **Local + Cloud synergy** – Lambda also sells on-prem GPU workstations/servers, making hybrid setups seamless.  
  - 📈 **Enterprise-grade scaling** – predictable multi-GPU training performance with NVLink-enabled clusters.  
  - 🌍 **Global regions** – U.S. and Europe data centers for lower latency training.  
  - 🧾 **Transparent pricing** – simpler than AWS, though typically higher than Vast.ai or RunPod spot instances.

  ## ⚡ Where Lambda Cloud Shines  

  - Teams that want **“plug-and-play” GPU training** without maintaining CUDA drivers.  
  - Enterprises standardizing on Lambda’s **workstation + cloud** combo.  
  - Researchers running **multi-GPU distributed training** with minimal config overhead.  

  ---

  ## ⚠️ Limitations  

  - Less flexible pricing than Vast.ai/RunPod (no cheap spot market).  
  - Fewer global regions than AWS or CoreWeave.  
  - Not ideal for **one-off low-cost experiments** — better for steady workloads.

  ## 🎯 Example in Action  

  A **computer vision startup** building large-scale detection models could:  
  1. Prototype locally on a Lambda workstation.  
  2. Push experiments to Lambda Cloud’s A100 clusters for distributed training.  
  3. Keep the same pre-configured environment across local + cloud, saving weeks of DevOps overhead.

  ## ⚔️ Comparisons  

  - **vs Genesis Cloud** → Genesis emphasizes **sustainability + affordability**; Lambda emphasizes **ready-to-use ML stack**.  
  - **vs RunPod/Vast.ai** → Lambda is more **stable and enterprise-ready**, but less flexible on cost.  
  - **vs CoreWeave** → CoreWeave focuses heavily on **VFX + large-scale GPU rentals**, Lambda is narrower on **AI workloads**.
