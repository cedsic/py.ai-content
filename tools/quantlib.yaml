  ## 🐍 QuantLib in Python: Sample Code 💻

  Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to price a European call option using QuantLib’s Python bindings:

  ```python
  import QuantLib as ql

  # Set evaluation date
  today = ql.Date(15, 6, 2024)
  ql.Settings.instance().evaluationDate = today

  # Option parameters
  spot_price = 100
  strike_price = 105
  volatility = 0.20  # 20%
  risk_free_rate = 0.01  # 1%
  dividend_rate = 0.00
  maturity = ql.Date(15, 9, 2024)

  # Construct the option payoff and exercise
  payoff = ql.PlainVanillaPayoff(ql.Option.Call, strike_price)
  exercise = ql.EuropeanExercise(maturity)

  # Create the option
  european_option = ql.VanillaOption(payoff, exercise)

  # Market data
  spot_handle = ql.QuoteHandle(ql.SimpleQuote(spot_price))
  flat_ts = ql.YieldTermStructureHandle(ql.FlatForward(today, risk_free_rate, ql.Actual365Fixed()))
  dividend_ts = ql.YieldTermStructureHandle(ql.FlatForward(today, dividend_rate, ql.Actual365Fixed()))
  vol_ts = ql.BlackVolTermStructureHandle(ql.BlackConstantVol(today, ql.TARGET(), volatility, ql.Actual365Fixed()))

  # Black-Scholes-Merton process
  bsm_process = ql.BlackScholesMertonProcess(spot_handle, dividend_ts, flat_ts, vol_ts)

  # Pricing engine
  engine = ql.AnalyticEuropeanEngine(bsm_process)
  european_option.setPricingEngine(engine)

  # Calculate and print the option price
  npv = european_option.NPV()
  print(f"European Call Option Price: {npv:.2f}")
  ```
