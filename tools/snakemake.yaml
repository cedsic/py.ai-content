  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects

  Snakemake workflows are defined in `Snakefiles` using a Python-based domain-specific language (DSL). Each **rule** specifies:

  - **input** files
  - **output** files
  - **shell** or **script** commands to transform inputs into outputs
  - Optional **resources** and **environment** specifications

  Snakemake builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of jobs at runtime, ensuring tasks execute in the correct order and maximizing parallelism.

  ### Minimal Example Snakefile

  ```python
  rule all:
      input:
          "results/analysis.txt"

  rule analyze_data:
      input:
          "data/raw_data.csv"
      output:
          "results/analysis.txt"
      shell:
          """
          python scripts/analyze.py {input} > {output}
          """
  ```
  <br>
  This workflow defines two rules:

  - `all`: The final target file.
  - `analyze_data`: Processes raw data into an analysis result.

  Snakemake will automatically run `analyze_data` before `all`, ensuring dependencies are respected.

  ## 🐍 Python Ecosystem Relevance

  Snakemake is deeply embedded in the Python ecosystem:

  - Workflow files are Python scripts, allowing for full Python expressiveness.
  - Supports Python-based scripts and libraries inside rules.
  - Can be extended with custom Python functions or modules.
  - Integrates smoothly with scientific Python tools like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
  - Enables reproducible data science workflows fully controlled by Python code.
