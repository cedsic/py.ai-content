  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  Modern TTS systems rely on deep learning architectures such as:

  - **Tacotron 2 / Transformer-based Models:** Convert text sequences into mel-spectrograms.  
  - **WaveNet / WaveGlow / HiFi-GAN:** Neural vocoders that synthesize high-fidelity audio from spectrograms.  
  - **Prosody Modeling:** Captures rhythm, stress, and intonation to make speech more human-like.  

  The pipeline usually involves:

  1. **Text Normalization:** Converts raw text into a phonetic or linguistic representation.  
  2. **Acoustic Modeling:** Generates intermediate audio features.  
  3. **Vocoder:** Synthesizes waveform audio from features.

  ## 🐍 Python Example: Using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)

  ```python
  from gtts import gTTS
  import os

  text = "Hello! Welcome to the world of Text-to-Speech technology."
  tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en', slow=False)
  tts.save("welcome.mp3")

  # Play the audio (Linux example)
  os.system("mpg123 welcome.mp3")
  ```
  <br>
  This simple snippet generates an MP3 audio file from text using Google's free TTS API.
