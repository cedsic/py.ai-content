  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview 📊

  AI21 Studio offers a robust REST API that accepts prompt text and returns model-generated completions. The API supports parameters to control:

  - **`temperature`**: Controls randomness/creativity of output.
  - **`maxTokens`**: Limits the length of the generated text.
  - **`stopSequences`**: Defines tokens where generation should stop.
  - **`topP` and `topK`**: Sampling parameters for fine-tuning output diversity.

  The platform is built on large transformer-based language models trained on massive datasets, optimized for both speed and quality.

  ## 🐍 Python Example: Generate Text with AI21 Studio 💻

  AI21 Studio provides powerful **natural language generation APIs** that allow developers to generate high-quality text programmatically. This can be used for product descriptions, summaries, creative writing, and more.
  <br><br>
  The following Python example demonstrates how to generate text using the **AI21 Studio J1-Large model**. It sends a prompt to the API and retrieves the generated completion:

  ```python
  import requests

  API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
  API_URL = 'https://api.ai21.com/studio/v1/j1-large/complete'

  headers = {
      'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }

  data = {
      "prompt": "Write a creative product description for a smart home thermostat:",
      "maxTokens": 100,
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "topP": 1,
      "stopSequences": ["."]
  }

  response = requests.post(API_URL, json=data, headers=headers)
  result = response.json()

  print("Generated Text:\n", result['completions'][0]['data']['text'])
  ```
  <br>
  **How it works:**  
  Set your API key, define a prompt, configure basic generation parameters, send a request to AI21 Studio, and receive the generated text.  
  This illustrates how to quickly integrate AI21’s language models into Python applications for automated content creation.
