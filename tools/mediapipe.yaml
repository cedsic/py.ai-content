  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  At its core, MediaPipe uses a **graph-based architecture**, where each node (called a *calculator*) performs a specific operation — e.g., image decoding, ML inference, or postprocessing. These calculators are connected into directed acyclic graphs that define the full data pipeline.

  - **Graphs** are defined using `.pbtxt` files or programmatically.
  - **Calculators** are reusable C++ or Python modules.
  - Supports **hardware acceleration** via GPU and DSP for mobile.
  - Designed to be adaptable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, including microcontrollers, enabling real-time perception in embedded and edge computing scenarios.
  - Offers **Python bindings** for easy experimentation and integration.

  ## 🐍 MediaPipe in Python: A Simple Hand Tracking Example

  ```python
  import cv2
  import mediapipe as mp

  mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands
  mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

  # Initialize MediaPipe Hands
  with mp_hands.Hands(
      static_image_mode=False,
      max_num_hands=2,
      min_detection_confidence=0.7) as hands:

      cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
      while cap.isOpened():
          ret, frame = cap.read()
          if not ret:
              break

          # Convert the BGR image to RGB
          image = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
          image.flags.writeable = False

          # Process the image and detect hands
          results = hands.process(image)

          # Draw hand landmarks
          image.flags.writeable = True
          image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
          if results.multi_hand_landmarks:
              for hand_landmarks in results.multi_hand_landmarks:
                  mp_drawing.draw_landmarks(
                      image, hand_landmarks, mp_hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS)

          cv2.imshow('MediaPipe Hands', image)
          if cv2.waitKey(5) & 0xFF == 27:
              break
      cap.release()
      cv2.destroyAllWindows()
