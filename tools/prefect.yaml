  ## 🏗️ Technical Overview

  Prefect’s architecture centers around two main concepts:

  - **Tasks:** The smallest unit of work, defined as Python functions or callables.
  - **Flows:** Compositions of tasks, defining dependencies and execution order, enabling sequential processing or parallel execution as needed.

  Prefect manages **state** transitions (e.g., Pending → Running → Success/Failure) and offers a rich API for controlling execution, retries, and concurrency.

  ### Example: A Simple Prefect Flow in Python

  ```python
  from prefect import flow, task
  from prefect.tasks import task_input_hash
  from datetime import timedelta

  @task(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=10, cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(days=1))
  def extract_data():
      print("Extracting data...")
      # Simulate data extraction logic
      return {"data": [1, 2, 3, 4]}

  @task
  def transform_data(data):
      print("Transforming data...")
      return [x * 10 for x in data["data"]]

  @task
  def load_data(transformed_data):
      print(f"Loading data: {transformed_data}")

  @flow(name="ETL Pipeline")
  def etl_pipeline():
      raw = extract_data()
      transformed = transform_data(raw)
      load_data(transformed)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      etl_pipeline()
  ```
  <br>
  This example demonstrates Prefect’s simplicity — defining tasks with retries and caching, composing them into a flow, and running the pipeline with full observability.
