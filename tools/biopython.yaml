  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects

  BioPython is implemented in pure Python with optional C extensions for performance-critical components. It supports Python 3.x and is installable via pip: `pip install biopython`

  Its modular architecture includes subpackages such as:

  - `Bio.Seq` — sequence objects and operations  
  - `Bio.Align` — alignment handling  
  - `Bio.PDB` — protein structure analysis  
  - `Bio.Entrez` — NCBI database access  
  - `Bio.Phylo` — phylogenetic tree manipulation

  ## 🧪 Example: DNA Sequence Analysis with BioPython

  Here’s a simple script demonstrating loading a DNA sequence, transcribing to RNA, and translating to a protein:

  ```python
  from Bio.Seq import Seq

  # Define a DNA sequence
  dna_seq = Seq("ATGGCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG")

  # Transcribe DNA to RNA
  rna_seq = dna_seq.transcribe()
  print(f"RNA Sequence: {rna_seq}")

  # Translate RNA to Protein
  protein_seq = rna_seq.translate()
  print(f"Protein Sequence: {protein_seq}")
  ```
  <br>
  **Output:**

  ```
  RNA Sequence: AUGGCCAUUGUAAUGGGCCGCUGAAAGGGUGCCCGAUAG
  Protein Sequence: MAIVMGR*KGAR*
  ```
