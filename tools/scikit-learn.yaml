  ### 🛠️ Example in Action
  A **data science team** can use scikit-learn to build a **credit risk prediction model**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  import pandas as pd

  # Load data
  data = pd.read_csv("credit_data.csv")
  X = data.drop("default", axis=1)
  y = data["default"]

  # Preprocess features
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

  # Split data
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

  # Train model
  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Evaluate model
  scores = cross_val_score(model, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
  print("Cross-validated accuracy:", scores.mean())
  ```
