  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview 🧩

  At its core, OpenCV is a collection of over 2500 optimized algorithms implemented primarily in C++ for speed. Python bindings expose these functionalities with a simple, intuitive API.

  - **Data Structures:** Images are handled as NumPy arrays (`cv2.imread()` returns an ndarray).
  - **Modular Design:** Organized into modules like `core`, `imgproc`, `video`, `features2d`, `calib3d`, and `dnn`.
  - **Hardware Acceleration:** Supports OpenCL, CUDA, and Intel IPP for faster computation.
  - **Deep Learning:** Includes a DNN module to load models from frameworks like Caffe, TensorFlow, and ONNX.

  ## 🐍 OpenCV in Python: Example Code 📝

  Here’s a simple example demonstrating real-time face detection using OpenCV’s Haar cascades:

  ```python
  import cv2

  # Load pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection
  face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

  # Open webcam stream
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

  while True:
      ret, frame = cap.read()
      if not ret:
          break

      # Convert to grayscale for detection
      gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

      # Detect faces
      faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5)

      # Draw rectangles around faces
      for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
          cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

      # Display the output
      cv2.imshow('Face Detection', frame)

      # Exit on pressing 'q'
      if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
          break

  cap.release()
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()
  ```
