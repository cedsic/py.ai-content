overview: |
  In today’s AI landscape, coordinating large numbers of agents often comes with challenges like bottlenecks, single points of failure, and centralized control issues. **Swarms** is a cutting-edge framework inspired by nature’s swarm intelligence — the collective behavior seen in bees, ants, and birds — designed to overcome these challenges by enabling **decentralized, resilient, and scalable multi-agent systems**.
  <br>
  By mimicking how natural swarms self-organize and adapt, Swarms empowers developers and researchers to build AI ecosystems where agents collaborate seamlessly, dynamically solving complex problems without relying on a central brain.

  ## 🐍 Python Example: Coordinating a Simple Swarm 🐝

  ```python
  from swarms import Agent, Swarm

  class DeliveryDrone(Agent):
      def __init__(self, agent_id):
          super().__init__(agent_id)
          self.task = None

      def on_message(self, msg):
          if msg['type'] == 'task_assignment':
              self.task = msg['task']
              print(f"Drone {self.agent_id} assigned to {self.task}")

      def perform_task(self):
          if self.task:
              print(f"Drone {self.agent_id} performing {self.task}")
              # Simulate task completion
              self.task = None

  # Initialize swarm with 5 drones
  swarm = Swarm()

  for i in range(5):
      drone = DeliveryDrone(agent_id=i)
      swarm.add_agent(drone)

  # Assign tasks dynamically
  swarm.broadcast({'type': 'task_assignment', 'task': 'Deliver Package A'})

  # Run swarm cycle
  swarm.step()
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet demonstrates how lightweight agents (drones) can receive tasks and operate autonomously within a swarm, coordinating without central control.
