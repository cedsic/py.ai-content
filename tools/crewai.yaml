  ## 🐍 Python Example: Coordinating Agents with CrewAI SDK

  ```python
  from crewai import Crew, Agent

  # Define specialized agents
  researcher = Agent(name="Researcher", role="data_gatherer")
  writer = Agent(name="Writer", role="content_creator")
  seo = Agent(name="SEO Specialist", role="optimizer")

  # Create a Crew instance and add agents
  crew = Crew(name="MarketingCampaign")
  crew.add_agents([researcher, writer, seo])

  # Define a collaborative workflow
  def campaign_workflow():
      data = researcher.collect_data(topic="AI trends 2024")
      draft = writer.create_content(data)
      optimized_content = seo.optimize(draft)
      return optimized_content

  # Execute workflow
  result = crew.execute(campaign_workflow)
  print("Final Output:", result)
  ```
