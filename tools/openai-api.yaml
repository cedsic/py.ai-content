  ### 📄 Example: Excel/PDF/Image Content Summarization
  <br>
  #### 🔗 Tool documentation: <a href="https://github.com/cedsic/py-ai-extract-summarize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Repository</a>

  This tool provides a unified command-line interface to **extract and summarize content from unstructured data sources and files** such as PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and CSVs. It is especially useful for managing **content overload**, transforming large volumes of raw data into clear, concise, and actionable insights.

  It combines Python utilities with AI models powered by the **OpenAI API**, which offers access to **proprietary generative models** developed by OpenAI, helping you quickly turn raw documents into clear, usable insights.

  #### 💻 Quick CLI Usage

  ```bash
  # Summarize an Excel file
  py-ai summarize /path/to/file.xlsx --max-chars 800

  # Summarize a PDF file
  py-ai summarize /path/to/file.pdf --max-chars 800

  # Summarize text extracted from an image
  py-ai summarize /path/to/file.png --max-chars 800
  ```

  #### 🐍 Python Code: Summarize Document Content with OpenAI API

  The summarization process aims not only to condense content but also to ensure **safe responses** that avoid inappropriate or harmful outputs, leveraging the OpenAI API's built-in safety mechanisms.

  ```python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  from openai import OpenAI

  load_dotenv()
  client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

  def summarize_text(text: str, max_chars: int = 800, role: str = "assistant") -> str:
      """
      Summarize text using OpenAI API.
      """
      if not text.strip():
          return ""
      prompt = f"Summarize the following text in less than {max_chars} characters:\n\n{text}"
      response = client.responses.create(
          model="gpt-5-nano",
          input=[
              {"role": "system", "content": f"You are a helpful {role} that summarizes text clearly and concisely."},
              {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
          ]
      )
      return response.output_text.strip()
  ```
