  ## 💻 Example: Using PromptLayer with Python & OpenAI

  ```python
  import openai
  from promptlayer import promptlayer_openai

  # Wrap OpenAI API calls with PromptLayer to enable automatic prompt logging
  openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
  promptlayer_openai.api_key = "your-promptlayer-api-key"

  response = promptlayer_openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-003",
      prompt="Write a creative tagline for a new eco-friendly water bottle.",
      max_tokens=20,
      temperature=0.7
  )

  print("Generated Tagline:", response.choices[0].text.strip())
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet shows how simply wrapping your OpenAI calls with `promptlayer_openai` captures prompt inputs and outputs automatically, enabling full traceability and analytics.
