  ## 🐍 Python Example: Tracking a Simple Experiment with Comet.ml 💻

  ```python
  from comet_ml import Experiment
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

  # Initialize Comet experiment
  experiment = Experiment(
      api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
      project_name="iris-classification",
      workspace="your-workspace"
  )

  # Load data
  data = load_iris()
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

  # Log parameters
  params = {"n_estimators": 100, "max_depth": 5, "random_state": 42}
  experiment.log_parameters(params)

  # Train model
  model = RandomForestClassifier(**params)
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Predict and evaluate
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
  acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

  # Log metric
  experiment.log_metric("accuracy", acc)

  print(f"Test Accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
  ```
  <br>
  The script trains a Random Forest model on the Iris dataset while logging key experiment details—such as parameters and accuracy—to Comet.ml. This enables easy comparison of multiple runs, helps visualize model performance, and supports reproducibility in ML workflows.
