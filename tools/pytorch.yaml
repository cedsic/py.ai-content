overview: |
  PyTorch is a **leading open-source deep learning framework** that empowers researchers, data scientists, and engineers to build, train, and deploy neural networks with unmatched flexibility and speed. Developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab (FAIR), PyTorch has quickly become the go-to tool for both academic research and production environments due to its intuitive design and powerful capabilities.
  <br>
  Unlike traditional frameworks that rely on static computation graphs, PyTorch embraces a **dynamic computation graph** approach, enabling developers to modify models on the fly and experiment freely without sacrificing performance.

  ## 🐍 Example: Building a Simple Neural Network in PyTorch 🐍

  ```python
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  import torch.optim as optim

  # Define a simple feedforward neural network
  class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self):
          super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
          self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28*28, 128)
          self.relu = nn.ReLU()
          self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
      
      def forward(self, x):
          x = x.view(-1, 28*28)  # Flatten input
          x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
          return self.fc2(x)

  # Instantiate model, loss, and optimizer
  model = SimpleNN()
  criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
  optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

  # Dummy input and target
  inputs = torch.randn(64, 1, 28, 28)  # batch_size=64, 28x28 grayscale images
  targets = torch.randint(0, 10, (64,))

  # Forward pass
  outputs = model(inputs)
  loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
