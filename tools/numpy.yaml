overview: |
  NumPy (Numerical Python) is the **fundamental package for numerical computing** in Python. It provides powerful data structures, primarily the **ndarray**, enabling efficient storage and manipulation of large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. By combining ease of use with high-performance C-based implementations, NumPy has become the cornerstone for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning in Python.

  ## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

  - **📊 Multi-Dimensional Arrays (`ndarray`)**  
    At its heart, NumPy introduces the `ndarray`, a fast, space-efficient container for homogeneous data that supports vectorized operations.

  - **⚡ Optimized Numerical Operations**  
    Implements element-wise arithmetic, broadcasting, and advanced indexing, all optimized in low-level C code for speed.

  - **📐 Comprehensive Mathematical Functions**  
    Includes a rich library of functions for:
      - Linear algebra (dot products, matrix decompositions) ➗
      - Statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation) 📈
      - Fourier transforms 🔄
      - Random number generation and sampling 🎲

  - **💾 Memory Efficiency & Performance**  
    Enables handling of large datasets with minimal memory overhead and significant speed gains compared to pure Python loops.

  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects

  - **Core Data Structure:** `numpy.ndarray`  
    A fixed-size, homogeneous, multidimensional array.

  - **Broadcasting:**  
    Enables arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit replication.

  - **Universal Functions (ufuncs):**  
    Vectorized wrappers for fast element-wise operations.

  - **Memory Layout:**  
    Supports both C-contiguous and Fortran-contiguous arrays, important for interfacing with other languages.

  ## 🧑‍💻 Example: NumPy in Action

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Create a 3x3 matrix
  matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6],
                    [7, 8, 9]])

  # Compute the matrix transpose
  transpose = matrix.T

  # Calculate the matrix product
  product = np.dot(matrix, transpose)

  print("Original matrix:\n", matrix)
  print("Transpose:\n", transpose)
  print("Product:\n", product)
  ```

  <br>
  **Output:**
  ```
  Original matrix:
  [[1 2 3]
    [4 5 6]
    [7 8 9]]
  Transpose:
  [[1 4 7]
    [2 5 8]
    [3 6 9]]
  Product:
  [[14 32 50]
    [32 77 122]
    [50 122 194]]
  ```
