overview: |
  In today’s data-driven world, handling **large-scale datasets** efficiently is a critical challenge. Enter **Dask** — an open-source Python library designed to extend the familiar interfaces of NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, enabling **parallel and distributed computing** on datasets that exceed a single machine’s memory.
  <br>
  Dask empowers data scientists, engineers, and researchers to scale their workflows seamlessly — from a laptop to a cluster — with minimal code changes. Whether you’re crunching terabytes of data or accelerating complex computations, Dask is built to make large-scale data processing accessible and performant.

  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects

  Dask is built around two main components:

  1. **Collections:** High-level parallel data structures (e.g., `dask.array`, `dask.dataframe`, `dask.bag`) that mimic NumPy, pandas, and Python iterables but operate lazily and in parallel.
  2. **Scheduler:** Executes task graphs using one of several schedulers:
      - **Single-machine schedulers:** Threaded, multiprocessing, synchronous.
      - **Distributed scheduler:** A robust, scalable scheduler for clusters with fault tolerance and diagnostics.

  The **lazy evaluation** model lets Dask build a task graph before execution, optimizing the computation plan and minimizing memory use.

  ## 🐍 Example: Parallel DataFrame Processing with Dask

  ```python
  import dask.dataframe as dd

  # Load a large CSV dataset (e.g., multi-GB file)
  df = dd.read_csv('s3://my-bucket/large-dataset-*.csv')

  # Compute average value grouped by a column
  result = df.groupby('category')['value'].mean().compute()

  print(result)
  ```
  <br>
  This example shows how you can process datasets larger than memory using familiar pandas-like syntax. The `.compute()` triggers parallel execution.
