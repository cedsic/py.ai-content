  ## 🐍 Vosk in Python: Quick Start Example

  ```python
  import queue
  import sounddevice as sd
  from vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer

  # Load Vosk model (download from official repo)
  model = Model("model")

  # Setup audio stream parameters
  sample_rate = 16000
  q = queue.Queue()

  def callback(indata, frames, time, status):
      q.put(bytes(indata))

  # Initialize recognizer
  recognizer = KaldiRecognizer(model, sample_rate)

  # Start audio stream
  with sd.RawInputStream(samplerate=sample_rate, blocksize=8000, dtype='int16',
                        channels=1, callback=callback):
      print("Start speaking...")
      while True:
          data = q.get()
          if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
              result = recognizer.Result()
              print("Recognized:", result)
          else:
              partial = recognizer.PartialResult()
              print("Partial:", partial)
  ```
  <br>
  This example captures microphone input and prints recognized text in real time — all **offline**.
