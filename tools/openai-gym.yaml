  ## Technical Overview

  At its core, Gym environments adhere to a simple, **consistent API**:

  - `env.reset()` — Initializes the environment and returns the initial observation.
  - `env.step(action)` — Applies an action, returns `(observation, reward, done, info)`.
  - `env.render()` — Visualizes the current state (optional).
  - `env.close()` — Cleans up resources.

  This abstraction allows RL agents to focus purely on learning policies without worrying about environment-specific details.

  ## Example: Training a Simple Agent on CartPole 🎯

  ```python
  import gym

  # Create the environment
  env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

  # Reset environment to initial state
  observation = env.reset()

  for _ in range(1000):
      env.render()
      
      # Sample random action from action space
      action = env.action_space.sample()
      
      # Take action and observe results
      observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
      
      if done:
          observation = env.reset()

  env.close()
  ```

  This snippet runs a random agent in the classic CartPole environment, showcasing the simplicity of Gym’s API.
