overview: |
  **spaCy** is a powerful, **open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in Python. It helps computers understand and work with human language — like **reading, analyzing, and extracting meaning from text**. Unlike many libraries that are research-focused or slow prototypes, **spaCy is designed for real-world, production use**. It’s **fast, reliable, and easy to integrate** into applications.
  <br><br>
  Working with text data can be complicated — you might need to **break sentences into words**, **identify parts of speech**, **find names of people or places**, or **understand sentence structure**. **spaCy combines all these steps into one smooth, efficient pipeline** so you don’t have to piece together multiple tools yourself. It also provides **pretrained statistical models** and **supports multiple languages**, making it versatile for many NLP tasks.

  ### 🔑 Key features

  - **Integrated NLP Pipeline:** Automatically processes text through tokenization (splitting text into words), part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing (understanding sentence structure), and named entity recognition (finding names, dates, organizations, etc.).
  - **Pretrained Statistical Models:** Comes with ready-to-use models trained on large datasets, giving you high accuracy out of the box.
  - **🌍 Multilingual Support:** Supports over 60 languages, making it useful for global applications.
  - **⚡ Production-Ready Performance:** Written in Cython for speed, spaCy can handle millions of documents efficiently and supports multi-threading.
  - **🔧 Extensibility:** Easily customizable with your own models or rules, and integrates well with deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.
  - **🌐 Rich Ecosystem:** Includes tools like **spaCy Universe** for plugins, **Prodigy** for annotation, and **Thinc** for machine learning model building.

  ### ⚙️ How Does spaCy Work? (Technical Overview)

  spaCy is built around a **pipeline architecture**, where raw text is processed step-by-step by a series of components, each adding annotations or extracting features:

  1. **Tokenizer:** Splits raw text into tokens (words, punctuation, numbers). This step is language-specific and handles complex cases like contractions and hyphenation.
  2. **Tagger:** Assigns part-of-speech (POS) tags to each token, e.g., noun, verb, adjective.
  3. **Parser:** Analyzes the syntactic structure of sentences, producing a dependency parse tree that links tokens based on grammatical relations.
  4. **Named Entity Recognizer (NER):** Identifies and classifies named entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
  5. **Lemmatizer:** Reduces words to their base or dictionary form.
  6. **Text Categorizer:** Classifies text into predefined categories (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
  7. **Custom Components:** You can add your own pipeline steps for specialized processing.

  Under the hood, spaCy uses **Cython** (a Python-to-C compiler) to achieve high performance, and its models are statistical, trained on large annotated corpora using machine learning algorithms. It supports GPU acceleration via integration with deep learning frameworks.

  ### 💻 Sample Code

  Here’s a simple example illustrating spaCy’s basic usage. The goal of the code is to analyze a sentence linguistically using spaCy to identify each word’s grammatical role and extract named entities like organizations, locations, and monetary values.

  ```python
  import spacy

  # Load the English model
  nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

  # Process a text
  doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion.")

  # Tokenization and POS tagging
  for token in doc:
      print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)

  # Named Entity Recognition
  for ent in doc.ents:
      print(ent.text, ent.label_)

  # Output:
  # Apple PROPN nsubj
  # is AUX aux
  # looking VERB ROOT
  # at ADP prep
  # buying VERB pcomp
  # U.K. PROPN compound
  # startup NOUN dobj
  # for ADP prep
  # $ SYM quantmod
  # 1 NUM compound
  # billion NUM pobj
  # . PUNCT punct

  # Apple ORG
  # U.K. GPE
  # $1 billion MONEY
  ```

  ### 💰 Pricing

  spaCy itself is **completely free and open-source** under the MIT license, which means you can use it, modify it, and distribute it without cost. This makes it accessible for startups, researchers, and enterprises alike.

  However, the company behind spaCy, Explosion, offers **commercial products and services**, including:

  - **Prodigy:** A powerful annotation tool for creating training data, priced per user (typically around $390 per user, one-time license).
  - **Explosion’s Enterprise Support:** Custom support, training, and consulting services for organizations with specific needs.
  - **Cloud Services:** Some cloud-based NLP APIs or hosted solutions may be available, often priced based on usage.

  For most users, the open-source spaCy library is sufficient, but companies building large-scale or specialized applications might consider these paid options.
