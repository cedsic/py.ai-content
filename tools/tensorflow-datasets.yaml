overview: |
  In the fast-paced world of machine learning, **access to clean, well-structured, and standardized datasets** is often a critical bottleneck. Enter **TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)** — an open-source library that provides a **curated collection of ready-to-use datasets** optimized for TensorFlow and other ML frameworks. TFDS simplifies the data pipeline by offering **versioned, consistent, and multi-modal datasets** that enable researchers, educators, and engineers to focus on building and evaluating models instead of wrangling data.

  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  TFDS is implemented in Python and provides a high-level API to:

  1. 📥 **Download** dataset files from remote sources.
  2. 🛠️ **Prepare** datasets by extracting, decoding, and formatting data.
  3. 📂 **Load** datasets as iterable `tf.data.Dataset` objects or NumPy arrays.
  4. 🏷️ **Version** datasets to guarantee reproducibility.
  5. 🧩 **Extend** with custom datasets if needed.

  Datasets are stored in a local cache directory (`~/tensorflow_datasets/` by default) to avoid repeated downloads.

  ## 🐍 Example: Loading and Using MNIST with TFDS

  ```python
  import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
  import tensorflow as tf

  # Load MNIST dataset (train and test splits)
  (ds_train, ds_test), ds_info = tfds.load(
      'mnist',
      split=['train', 'test'],
      shuffle_files=True,
      as_supervised=True,
      with_info=True,
  )

  # Prepare the dataset for training
  def normalize_img(image, label):
      return tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0, label

  ds_train = ds_train.map(normalize_img).cache().shuffle(1000).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  ds_test = ds_test.map(normalize_img).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

  # Build a simple model
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=ds_info.features['image'].shape),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
  ])

  model.compile(
      optimizer='adam',
      loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
      metrics=['accuracy'],
  )

  # Train the model
  model.fit(ds_train, epochs=5, validation_data=ds_test)
  ```
