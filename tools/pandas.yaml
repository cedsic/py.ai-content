  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects

  At its core, pandas revolves around two data structures:

  - **Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
  - **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be different types.

  Its operations are **vectorized**, meaning they apply over entire arrays without explicit Python loops, resulting in significant speed-ups. pandas also supports **indexing** and **hierarchical indexing (MultiIndex)**, enabling complex data slicing and selection.

  ## 🐍 Example: Quick Data Analysis with pandas

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  # Sample sales data
  data = {
      'Date': pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=6),
      'Region': ['East', 'West', 'East', 'West', 'East', 'West'],
      'Sales': [250, 200, 300, 220, 280, 210]
  }

  df = pd.DataFrame(data)

  # Set Date as index
  df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

  # Calculate total sales by region
  total_sales = df.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum()

  # Calculate 3-day rolling average sales
  df['Rolling_Avg'] = df['Sales'].rolling(window=3).mean()

  print("Total Sales by Region:")
  print(total_sales)
  print("\nData with Rolling Average:")
  print(df)
  ```
  <br>
  **Output:**

  ```
  Total Sales by Region:
  Region
  East    830
  West    630
  Name: Sales, dtype: int64

  Data with Rolling Average:
              Region  Sales  Rolling_Avg
  Date                                  
  2023-01-01   East    250          NaN
  2023-01-02   West    200          NaN
  2023-01-03   East    300   250.000000
  2023-01-04   West    220   240.000000
  2023-01-05   East    280   266.666667
  2023-01-06   West    210   236.666667
  ```
