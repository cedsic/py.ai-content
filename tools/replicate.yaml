  ## 🐍 Python Example

  Here’s a quick example demonstrating how to generate an image using a popular model on Replicate with their Python client:

  ```python
  import replicate

  # Authenticate with your API token
  client = replicate.Client(api_token="your_api_token_here")

  # Select a model (e.g., Stable Diffusion)
  model = client.models.get("stability-ai/stable-diffusion")

  # Run inference with a prompt
  output = model.predict(prompt="A futuristic cityscape at sunset")

  print("Generated image URL:", output)
  ```
