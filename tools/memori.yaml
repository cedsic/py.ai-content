overview: |
  In the world of conversational AI, **memory is everything**. Most chatbots and virtual assistants start fresh with every session, forgetting previous interactions and forcing users to repeat themselves. This leads to robotic, impersonal experiences that frustrate users and limit engagement.
  <br>
  **Memori** changes the game by giving your AI a **true, persistent memory**—a structured and contextual knowledge layer that remembers and recalls information across conversations. This enables deeply personalized, human-like interactions that evolve over time.

  ### 🐍 Python Example: Using Memori with an LLM

  ```python
  from memori import MemoriClient
  from openai import OpenAI

  # Initialize clients
  memori = MemoriClient(api_key="your_memori_api_key")
  llm = OpenAI(api_key="your_openai_api_key")

  # Store user info persistently
  user_id = "user_123"
  memori.store(user_id, {"goals": "Lose 5kg", "last_workout": "2024-06-01"})

  # Retrieve context before generating response
  context = memori.retrieve(user_id)

  # Generate personalized response with context
  prompt = f"""
  User goals: {context.get('goals')}
  Last workout: {context.get('last_workout')}

  Provide a motivational message based on this info.
  """
  response = llm.chat(prompt)
  print(response)
  ```
