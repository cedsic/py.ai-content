  ## 🐍 Python Example: Launching a Training Job on Genesis Cloud

  Here’s a simple example demonstrating how you might connect to a Genesis Cloud instance and start training a PyTorch model.

  ```python
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  import torch.optim as optim
  from genesiscloud import GenesisAPI  # Hypothetical Python SDK

  # Initialize Genesis Cloud API client
  gc = GenesisAPI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Launch a GPU instance (e.g., V100)
  instance = gc.launch_instance(gpu_type="V100", region="iceland", duration_hours=4)

  print(f"Launched instance ID: {instance.id} with IP: {instance.ip_address}")

  # SSH or use remote execution to run training (simplified)
  # Example PyTorch training snippet
  class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          self.fc = nn.Linear(784, 10)

      def forward(self, x):
          return self.fc(x)

  model = SimpleNet().cuda()
  criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
  optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

  # Dummy training loop
  for epoch in range(5):
      inputs = torch.randn(64, 784).cuda()
      labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (64,)).cuda()

      optimizer.zero_grad()
      outputs = model(inputs)
      loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()

      print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

  # After training, terminate instance to save costs
  gc.terminate_instance(instance.id)
  print("Instance terminated.")
  ```
