  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects

  Plotly uses a **declarative JSON schema** to describe visualizations, which are then rendered using **D3.js** and **WebGL** on the frontend. This approach allows:

  - **High performance rendering** of large datasets.
  - Smooth **animations and transitions**.
  - Support for **responsive design** across devices.

  The Python API builds this JSON spec under the hood, abstracting away complexity while giving developers fine-grained control.

  ## 🐍 Plotly in Python: A Quick Example

  ```python
  import plotly.express as px
  import pandas as pd

  # Sample dataset: Gapminder data showing life expectancy over time
  df = px.data.gapminder().query("country=='Canada'")

  fig = px.line(df, x='year', y='lifeExp', title='Life Expectancy in Canada Over Time')
  fig.update_traces(mode='markers+lines')
  fig.show()
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet creates an interactive line chart with hover info, zoom, and pan capabilities — all with minimal code.
