  ## ⚙️ Technical Overview

  Stable Diffusion is based on **latent diffusion models (LDMs)**, a class of generative models that iteratively denoise a latent representation of an image from pure noise guided by a text encoder (usually CLIP). This approach balances computational efficiency with image quality.

  - **Model Architecture:**  
      - Text encoder (e.g., CLIP) converts prompts into embeddings.  
      - U-Net based diffusion model refines noisy latent vectors.  
      - Decoder transforms latent back to pixel space.

  - **Training Data:** Large-scale datasets of image-text pairs (e.g., LAION-5B) enable diverse and rich understanding.

  - **Open Weights:** Available on platforms like Hugging Face, facilitating community-driven innovation.

  ## 🐍 Python Example: Generate an Image with Stable Diffusion

  ```python
  from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
  import torch

  # Load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion pipeline
  model_id = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
  pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
  pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

  # Define your prompt
  prompt = "A futuristic city skyline at sunset, vibrant colors, digital art"

  # Generate image
  image = pipe(prompt, guidance_scale=7.5).images[0]

  # Save or display the image
  image.save("futuristic_city.png")
  image.show()
  ```
  <br>
  > 💡 *Note:* Running this requires a CUDA-enabled GPU and the `diffusers` library (`pip install diffusers transformers torch`).
