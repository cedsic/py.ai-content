overview: |
  **Apache MXNet** is a versatile, efficient, and scalable deep learning framework designed to simplify the building, training, and deployment of neural networks. It stands out by supporting both **imperative (dynamic)** and **symbolic (static)** programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their projects. Originally developed by Amazon and now an Apache Software Foundation project, MXNet is optimized for performance across a wide range of hardware — from CPUs and GPUs to multi-node distributed clusters.
