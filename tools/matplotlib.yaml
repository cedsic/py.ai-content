  ## 🔗 Integration with Other Tools 🔗

  Matplotlib is not just a standalone library; it is deeply embedded in Python’s data ecosystem:

  - **NumPy:** Uses NumPy arrays as data sources for efficient numerical plotting.
  - **pandas:** Provides `.plot()` methods that leverage Matplotlib under the hood for quick visualization of DataFrames.
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Inline rendering of plots with interactive backends.
  - **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, offering higher-level statistical plotting.
  - **SciPy & Statsmodels:** Visualize statistical results and scientific data.
  - **IPython:** Interactive plotting with widgets and real-time updates.
  - **Biopython:** Enables visualization of biological data and sequence analysis results using Matplotlib’s plotting capabilities.

  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects 🛠️

  Matplotlib’s architecture is built around the **Artist layer** — every component of a plot (lines, text, axes) is an “artist” object that can be manipulated independently. This object-oriented design allows:

  - **🎯 Fine-grained control** of plot components.
  - **🖼️ Multiple backends** for rendering: GUI (Tkinter, Qt), web (HTML5), and file outputs.
  - **🖱️ Event handling** for interactive plots (zoom, pan, tooltips).

  ## 📈 Example: Plotting a Simple Line Chart 📈

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np

  # Generate sample data
  x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
  y = np.sin(x)

  # Create the plot
  plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
  plt.plot(x, y, label='Sine Wave', color='blue', linewidth=2)
  plt.title('Simple Sine Wave Plot')
  plt.xlabel('X-axis')
  plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
  plt.legend()
  plt.grid(True)
  plt.show()
  ```
  <br>
  This snippet generates a clean, customizable sine wave plot — a perfect example of Matplotlib’s straightforward yet powerful API.
