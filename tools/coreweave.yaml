  ## 🐍 Python Example: Launching a Distributed PyTorch Job on CoreWeave

  Here's a minimal example showing how you might launch a distributed PyTorch training job using CoreWeave's Kubernetes infrastructure and PyTorch's `torch.distributed` package.

  ```python
  import torch
  import torch.distributed as dist
  from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

  def setup(rank, world_size):
      dist.init_process_group(
          backend='nccl', 
          init_method='env://', 
          world_size=world_size, 
          rank=rank
      )
      torch.cuda.set_device(rank)

  def cleanup():
      dist.destroy_process_group()

  def train(rank, world_size):
      setup(rank, world_size)
      model = YourModel().cuda(rank)
      ddp_model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
      
      # Your training loop here
      for epoch in range(num_epochs):
          # Forward, backward, optimize
          pass
      
      cleanup()

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      world_size = int(os.environ['WORLD_SIZE'])
      rank = int(os.environ['RANK'])
      train(rank, world_size)
  ```
