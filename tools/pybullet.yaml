  ## 🎬 PyBullet in Action: Sample Python Code

  ```python
  import pybullet as p
  import pybullet_data
  import time

  # Connect to physics server with GUI
  physicsClient = p.connect(p.GUI)

  # Set gravity
  p.setGravity(0, 0, -9.8)

  # Load plane and robot URDFs
  p.setAdditionalSearchPath(pybullet_data.getDataPath())
  planeId = p.loadURDF("plane.urdf")
  robotId = p.loadURDF("kuka_iiwa/model.urdf", useFixedBase=True)

  # Simple control loop: move joint 2 back and forth
  for i in range(1000):
      targetPos = 0.5 * (1 + p.sin(i * 0.01))
      p.setJointMotorControl2(robotId, 2, p.POSITION_CONTROL, targetPosition=targetPos)
      p.stepSimulation()
      time.sleep(1./240.)

  p.disconnect()
  ```
