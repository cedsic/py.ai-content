overview: |
  In a world where AI systems often forget what happened just moments ago, **Letta** empowers developers to build **persistent AI agents** that remember, learn, and evolve across multiple sessions. Unlike traditional AI tools that reset context after each interaction, Letta enables **long-term memory retention** and **modular intelligence**, making continuous workflows smarter, more reliable, and deeply personalized.
  <br>
  By bridging the gap between ephemeral AI chats and truly context-aware agents, Letta transforms how intelligent assistants operate—whether you're building research tools, workflow automations, or customer-facing bots.

  ## 🐍 Python Example: Building a Persistent AI Assistant with Letta 🐍

  ```python
  from letta import Agent, MemoryModule, SecureConnector

  # Initialize persistent memory (e.g., backed by Redis or a database)
  memory = MemoryModule(storage_uri="redis://localhost:6379/0")

  # Setup secure connector to external financial API
  finance_api = SecureConnector(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", endpoint="https://api.finance.com")

  # Define the AI agent with memory and external data access
  agent = Agent(memory=memory, connectors=[finance_api])

  # Sample interaction: remembering user's portfolio and providing updates
  response = agent.chat("Remember my portfolio: 100 shares of AAPL and 50 shares of TSLA.")
  print(response)

  # Later session: agent recalls portfolio and fetches latest prices
  response = agent.chat("What's the current value of my portfolio?")
  print(response)
  ```
