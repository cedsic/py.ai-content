  ## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

  SmolAgents is architected around **three core pillars**:

  1. **Reasoning Modules:** Components that interpret inputs, infer context, and decide next steps.
  2. **Planning Utilities:** Tools that break down goals into actionable sub-tasks and sequence them efficiently.
  3. **Execution Tools:** Interfaces to trigger actions, interact with APIs, or manipulate data.

  This modularity allows developers to **mix, extend, or replace** parts without rewriting the entire agent.

  ## 📝 Example: Building a Simple Reminder Agent in Python

  ```python
  from smolagents import Reasoner, Planner, Executor, Agent

  # Define a reasoning module that parses user input
  class ReminderReasoner(Reasoner):
      def reason(self, input_text):
          # Simple keyword-based reasoning
          if "remind me" in input_text.lower():
              return {"action": "set_reminder", "details": input_text}
          return {"action": "unknown"}

  # Define a planner that schedules the reminder
  class ReminderPlanner(Planner):
      def plan(self, reasoning_output):
          if reasoning_output["action"] == "set_reminder":
              # Extract time & message (simplified)
              return [{"task": "schedule_reminder", "payload": reasoning_output["details"]}]
          return []

  # Define an executor that performs the reminder scheduling
  class ReminderExecutor(Executor):
      def execute(self, tasks):
          for task in tasks:
              if task["task"] == "schedule_reminder":
                  print(f"Reminder scheduled: {task['payload']}")

  # Assemble the agent
  agent = Agent(
      reasoner=ReminderReasoner(),
      planner=ReminderPlanner(),
      executor=ReminderExecutor()
  )

  # Run the agent with some input
  agent.run("Please remind me to call Alice at 5 PM")
  ```

  ## 🤝 Integrating Letta and Swarms in SmolAgents

  SmolAgents can be extended and enhanced by integrating with powerful complementary tools like **Letta** and **Swarms**, enabling more advanced multi-agent coordination and distributed reasoning capabilities.

  - **Letta:** A lightweight toolkit for orchestrating language model workflows and chaining reasoning steps. Integrate Letta modules as custom reasoning or planning components within SmolAgents to leverage its expressive workflow definitions and reusable logic blocks.

  - **Swarms:** A framework for coordinating multiple autonomous agents that collaborate, compete, or share knowledge. Use Swarms to manage groups of SmolAgents instances working in parallel or distributed environments, enabling scalable and resilient multi-agent systems.

  ### How to integrate:

  ```python
  from smolagents import Agent
  from letta import Workflow
  from swarms import SwarmManager

  # Define a Letta workflow for reasoning
  lettra_workflow = Workflow(...)
  # Wrap Letta workflow as a SmolAgents Reasoner or Planner
  class LettaReasoner:
      def reason(self, input_text):
          return lettra_workflow.run(input_text)

  # Initialize SwarmManager to coordinate multiple agents
  swarm = SwarmManager()

  # Create agents with Letta-powered reasoners
  agent1 = Agent(reasoner=LettaReasoner(), planner=..., executor=...)
  agent2 = Agent(reasoner=LettaReasoner(), planner=..., executor=...)

  # Register agents with the swarm
  swarm.add_agent(agent1)
  swarm.add_agent(agent2)

  # Run swarm coordination loop
  swarm.run()
  ```
  <br>
  ### Benefits of this integration:

  - Combine SmolAgents' lightweight modularity with Letta's expressive workflows for enhanced reasoning.
  - Leverage Swarms to build distributed multi-agent systems that collaborate to solve complex tasks.
  - Scale autonomous AI deployments across edge devices or cloud clusters with coordinated agents.
  - Experiment with new agent interaction patterns and emergent behaviors using Swarms' flexible coordination.

  This integration empowers developers to build **next-level autonomous AI systems** by combining SmolAgents' core strengths with Letta's workflow orchestration and Swarms' multi-agent coordination.
