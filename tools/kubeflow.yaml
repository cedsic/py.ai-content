  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspects

  Kubeflow is composed of microservices and CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) deployed on Kubernetes. The architecture typically includes:

  - **Pipeline Orchestration:** Pipelines defined as DAGs, executed by Argo.
  - **Custom Controllers:** For managing distributed training jobs (e.g., TFJob).
  - **Metadata Store:** Centralized tracking of experiments and artifacts.
  - **Notebook Servers:** User-facing Jupyter environments running as pods.
  - **Model Serving:** Scalable inference endpoints with autoscaling and traffic splitting.

  Kubeflow leverages Kubernetes features such as namespaces, RBAC, and persistent volumes to isolate and secure workloads.

  ## 🐍 Python Ecosystem Relevance

  Kubeflow tightly integrates with Python, the lingua franca of ML:

  - Pipelines are authored using the **Kubeflow Pipelines SDK**, a Python client library.
  - Supports Python ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
  - Enables embedding Python code in pipeline components for custom data processing or model logic.

  ### Example: Defining a Simple Kubeflow Pipeline in Python

  ```python
  from kfp import dsl
  from kfp.components import create_component_from_func

  # Define a component
  def preprocess_op():
      print("Preprocessing data...")

  def train_op():
      print("Training model...")

  @dsl.pipeline(
      name='Simple ML Pipeline',
      description='An example pipeline with preprocessing and training steps.'
  )
  def simple_pipeline():
      preprocess = create_component_from_func(preprocess_op)()
      train = create_component_from_func(train_op)()
      train.after(preprocess)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      import kfp.compiler as compiler
      compiler.Compiler().compile(simple_pipeline, 'simple_pipeline.yaml')
  ```
  <br>
  This pipeline can then be uploaded to Kubeflow Pipelines UI or triggered programmatically.

  | **MLflow**              | Experiment tracking & lifecycle  | Open source, managed options (Databricks) |
  | **SageMaker**           | End-to-end AWS ML platform       | Pay-as-you-go (AWS pricing)          |
  | **Azure ML**             | Microsoft’s ML platform           | Subscription-based, pay per usage    |
  | **Google Vertex AI**    | Google’s managed ML platform      | Pay per usage (training, prediction) |
  | **Metaflow**            | Workflow orchestration for ML     | Open source, with managed AWS option |

  Kubeflow is **free and open-source**, but deploying it requires Kubernetes infrastructure, which can be on-premises or cloud-based, incurring typical compute/storage costs.
