overview: |
  **LangChain connects large language models (LLMs) to external data sources, APIs, and workflows, enabling developers to build intelligent, context-aware applications.**  
  Instead of manually coding complex orchestration logic for LLMs, LangChain provides a unified framework with reusable components like chains, agents, and memory, simplifying development and scaling.

  In other words:  
  - It helps you **combine prompts, tools, and data** into seamless workflows.  
  - It manages **state and context** automatically to create natural, multi-turn interactions.  
  - It integrates easily with databases, APIs, search engines, and more.

  ## 👥 Who Should Use LangChain?

  LangChain is designed for **developers, data scientists, startups, and enterprises** building applications powered by large language models. Common use cases include:

  - **💬 Conversational Agents:** Chatbots that remember context and use external data.  
  - **📚 Research Assistants:** Tools that summarize and analyze documents or datasets.  
  - **📖 Knowledge-Driven Applications:** Apps that integrate domain-specific knowledge bases with LLMs.  
  - **⚙️ Automation & Workflow Orchestration:** Automate tasks combining LLMs with APIs and databases.

  ## ⚙️ How Does LangChain Work?

  LangChain abstracts the complexity of LLM orchestration by modularizing components:

  - **Chains:** Sequences of calls to prompts, LLMs, or other chains, passing outputs as inputs.  
  - **Agents:** Autonomous entities that decide which tools to call based on user input and context.  
  - **Memory:** Stores conversation history or external state, enabling context-aware responses.  
  - **Tools:** External APIs, databases, or functions that agents can invoke dynamically.

  This modular design allows developers to mix and match components, scale applications, and maintain clean, testable codebases.

  ## 💰 Pricing and Competitor Comparison

  | Platform      | Pricing Model                          | Key Strengths                         | Notes                              |
  |---------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | **LangChain** | Open-source (free core library) + paid cloud services | Highly modular, strong community, flexible integrations | Often used with OpenAI API (separate cost) |
  | **Hugging Face** | Free for open models; paid for hosted inference | Large model hub, easy deployment | Focus on model hosting & fine-tuning |
  | **OpenAI API** | Pay-as-you-go per token usage        | State-of-the-art models, easy API   | No built-in orchestration tools   |
  | **Microsoft Bot Framework** | Free + Azure usage costs    | Enterprise-grade bot development    | Less focused on LLM orchestration |
  | **Rasa**      | Open-source + enterprise plans       | Conversational AI with NLU          | More rule-based, less LLM-centric |
  | **Memori**    | Free tier + Pro plans                 | Contextual memory for AI agents and chatbots | Focus on persistent memory and context management |

  LangChain stands out by focusing on **workflow orchestration and tool integration** rather than just providing models or chat frameworks.

  ## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

  - **Core Components:**
      - LLM classes wrap calls to language models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).
      - Support for models like Llama enables flexible use of open-source LLMs within LangChain workflows.
      - PromptTemplate defines dynamic prompts.
      - Chains link prompts, LLMs, and tools into workflows.
      - Agents use LLMs to decide which tools to invoke dynamically.
      - Memory stores conversation state (in-memory, Redis, or vector DBs).
      - Tools connect to external APIs or functions.
      - Data models and configurations leverage pydantic for robust validation and type enforcement.

  - **Execution Flow:**
      - User input → Agent interprets intent.
      - Agent selects tools to call.
      - Tools return data → Agent formats response using LLM.
      - Memory updates context for next interaction.

  - **Extensibility:**
      - Easily add custom tools, memory backends, prompt templates, or chain types.

  ## 💻 Example: Simple Conversational Chain in Python

  ```python
  from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate

  # Initialize LLM with your OpenAI API key
  llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

  # Define a prompt template with a variable input
  template = PromptTemplate(
      input_variables=["question"],
      template="You are a helpful assistant. Answer this question:\n{question}"
  )

  # Create a chain that combines the prompt and LLM
  chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=template)

  # Run the chain with a user question
  response = chain.run("What is LangChain and why is it useful?")

  print(response)
  ```
