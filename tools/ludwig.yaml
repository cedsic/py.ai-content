  ## 🐍 Ludwig in Python: Example Usage

  ```python
  from ludwig.api import LudwigModel

  # Define the model configuration as a dictionary (can also be YAML)
  model_definition = {
      'input_features': [
          {'name': 'text', 'type': 'text'},
          {'name': 'image_path', 'type': 'image'}
      ],
      'output_features': [
          {'name': 'sentiment', 'type': 'category'}
      ],
      'training': {
          'epochs': 5
      }
  }

  # Initialize the model
  model = LudwigModel(config=model_definition)

  # Train the model with a dataset (CSV with columns: text, image_path, sentiment)
  train_stats = model.train(dataset='data/multi_modal_data.csv')

  # Evaluate the model
  eval_stats = model.evaluate(dataset='data/multi_modal_test.csv')
