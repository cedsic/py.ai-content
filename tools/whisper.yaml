  ## 🐍 Whisper in Python: Quick Start Example 🐍

  ```python
  import whisper

  # Load the pre-trained Whisper model (options: tiny, base, small, medium, large)
  model = whisper.load_model("base")

  # Transcribe an audio file
  result = model.transcribe("audio_sample.mp3")

  # Access the transcription text
  print("Transcription:", result["text"])
  ```
