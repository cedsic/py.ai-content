  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects 🐍

  NLTK is implemented purely in Python, making it highly accessible and easy to install via pip: `pip install nltk`

  Its modular design allows users to import only the components they need, helping keep projects lightweight. NLTK relies on traditional NLP algorithms and symbolic methods rather than deep learning, making it ideal for educational purposes and classical NLP workflows.

  <br>
  ### Example: Basic Text Tokenization and POS Tagging 📝

  ```python
  import nltk
  from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
  from nltk import pos_tag

  # Download required resources (run once)
  nltk.download('punkt')
  nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

  text = "NLTK is a powerful toolkit for natural language processing in Python."
  tokens = word_tokenize(text)
  pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)

  print("Tokens:", tokens)
  print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
  ```

  <br>
  **Output:**

  ```
  Tokens: ['NLTK', 'is', 'a', 'powerful', 'toolkit', 'for', 'natural', 'language', 'processing', 'in', 'Python', '.']
  POS Tags: [('NLTK', 'NNP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('powerful', 'JJ'), ('toolkit', 'NN'), ('for', 'IN'), ('natural', 'JJ'), ('language', 'NN'), ('processing', 'NN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('Python', 'NNP'), ('.', '.')]
  ```
