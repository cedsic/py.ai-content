  ## 🐍 Example: Using MuJoCo with Python

  ```python
  import mujoco_py
  from mujoco_py import load_model_from_path, MjSim, MjViewer

  # Load a predefined MuJoCo model (e.g., a humanoid robot)
  model = load_model_from_path("humanoid.xml")
  sim = MjSim(model)
  viewer = MjViewer(sim)

  # Simulate 1000 steps with simple control
  for _ in range(1000):
      # Example: apply zero control (torques)
      sim.data.ctrl[:] = 0
      sim.step()
      viewer.render()
  ```
