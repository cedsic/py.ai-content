overview: |
  **Weights & Biases** is a powerful platform designed to simplify and supercharge machine learning workflows by providing seamless **experiment tracking**, **model management**, and **collaborative visualization**. It helps data scientists, ML engineers, and research teams organize, reproduce, and share their work effortlessly — eliminating the manual hassle and error-prone process of tracking experiments.
  <br>
  With W&B, every run, metric, hyperparameter, dataset version, and model artifact is automatically logged and visualized in real-time, enabling teams to focus on building better models instead of managing spreadsheets or scattered notes.

  ## 🐍 Python Example: Quickstart with PyTorch

  ```python
  import wandb
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  import torch.optim as optim
  from torchvision import datasets, transforms

  # Initialize a W&B run
  wandb.init(project="mnist-classification", entity="your_team")

  # Define a simple model
  class Net(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self):
          super(Net, self).__init__()
          self.fc = nn.Linear(28*28, 10)
      def forward(self, x):
          return self.fc(x.view(-1, 28*28))

  model = Net()
  optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
  criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

  # Watch model for gradients and parameter logging
  wandb.watch(model, log="all")

  # Prepare data
  train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
      datasets.MNIST('.', train=True, download=True, transform=transforms.ToTensor()),
      batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

  # Training loop
  for epoch in range(3):
      for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
          optimizer.zero_grad()
          output = model(data)
          loss = criterion(output, target)
          loss.backward()
          optimizer.step()

          # Log metrics to W&B
