overview: |
  **Bokeh** is a powerful, open-source Python library designed to create **rich, interactive visualizations** that run seamlessly in modern web browsers. Unlike static charts, Bokeh transforms your data into dynamic, explorable graphics, enabling users to interact with data through zooming, panning, tooltips, and real-time updates — all without needing to write complex JavaScript.

  ## ⚙️ Technical Aspects

  - **🏛️ Architecture:** Bokeh uses a **client-server model** where Python runs on the server side, generating JSON data and JavaScript code that renders plots in the browser.
  - **🖥️ Bokeh Server:** Enables real-time interactivity and streaming data by maintaining a websocket connection.
  - **📄 Output Modes:** 
      - Static HTML files
      - Embeddable components (JavaScript + HTML snippets)
      - Full Bokeh server apps for dynamic dashboards
  - **🧩 Custom Extensions:** Users can write custom JavaScript or TypeScript extensions to extend Bokeh’s capabilities.

  ## 🐍 Example: Creating an Interactive Scatter Plot in Python

  ```python
  from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
  from bokeh.models import HoverTool, ColumnDataSource

  # Sample data
  data = {
      'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      'y': [6, 7, 2, 4, 5],
      'desc': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
  }

  source = ColumnDataSource(data=data)

  # Create figure
  p = figure(title="Interactive Scatter Plot", tools="pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset")

  # Add circle glyphs
  p.circle('x', 'y', size=15, source=source, fill_alpha=0.6)

  # Add hover tooltips
  hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[("Index", "$index"), ("(x,y)", "(@x, @y)"), ("Desc", "@desc")])
  p.add_tools(hover)

  # Show plot
  show(p)
  ```

  > This simple example demonstrates how Bokeh allows you to add interactivity such as zooming and tooltips with just a few lines of Python.
