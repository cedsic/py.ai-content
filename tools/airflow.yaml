overview: |
  In today’s data-driven world, managing complex workflows and pipelines efficiently is crucial. **Apache Airflow** is a powerful open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows — making pipeline orchestration reliable, scalable, and maintainable. By treating workflows as code, Airflow eliminates manual inefficiencies and provides clear visibility into task execution, dependencies, and failures.

  ## 🛠️ Technical Aspect 

  At its core, Airflow models workflows as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** — a set of tasks with explicit dependencies that define execution order. The Airflow scheduler parses DAG files, triggers tasks based on schedules or external events, and distributes execution to workers.

  The architecture consists of:

  - **Scheduler:** Parses DAGs, schedules tasks.
  - **Executor:** Runs tasks (e.g., LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, KubernetesExecutor).
  - **Metadata Database:** Stores state and history (usually PostgreSQL or MySQL).
  - **Webserver:** Provides UI for monitoring and managing workflows.

  ## 🧪 Example: A Simple ETL Pipeline in Airflow 

  This example demonstrates a basic ETL pipeline using Airflow. It shows how to orchestrate tasks for extracting, transforming, and loading data in a structured workflow.

  ```python
  from airflow import DAG
  from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
  from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

  def extract():
      print("Extracting data...")

  def transform():
      print("Transforming data...")

  def load():
      print("Loading data...")

  default_args = {
      'owner': 'data_engineer',
      'start_date': days_ago(1),
      'retries': 1,
  }

  with DAG(
      'simple_etl',
      default_args=default_args,
      schedule_interval='@daily',
      catchup=False,
  ) as dag:

      t1 = PythonOperator(task_id='extract', python_callable=extract)
      t2 = PythonOperator(task_id='transform', python_callable=transform)
      t3 = PythonOperator(task_id='load', python_callable=load)

      t1 >> t2 >> t3  # Define task dependencies
  ```
  <br>
  The DAG runs daily, executing tasks sequentially, and illustrates how Airflow can manage and automate data pipelines efficiently.
