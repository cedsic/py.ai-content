  ## 🐍 Quick Start Example in Python 🐍

  ```python
  import autokeras as ak
  from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

  # Load dataset
  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

  # Initialize ImageClassifier
  clf = ak.ImageClassifier(max_trials=5, overwrite=True)

  # Train the model
  clf.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

  # Evaluate the best model
  accuracy = clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
  print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy}")

  # Export the best Keras model
  model = clf.export_model()
  model.summary()
  ```
  <br>
  This example demonstrates how easily you can train an image classifier with minimal code, leaving the architecture and hyperparameter search to AutoKeras.
